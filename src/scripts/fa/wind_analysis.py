Wind Analysis Factor

Analyzes wind conditions and their impact on hitting/pitching performance.
Wind direction and speed significantly affect ball flight and scoring.

Key Concepts:
- Tailwind (pitcher → home): Favorable for hitters, ball carries further
- Headwind (home → pitcher): Favorable for pitchers, ball held back
- Crosswinds: Affect ball trajectory sideways
- Wind speed amplifies these effects

Output:
- Wind component (tailwind/headwind in km/h)
- Crosswind component (km/h)
- Advantage score for hitters/pitchers
- Weather conditions
