"""
Bullpen Fatigue Detection Factor Analysis

Analyzes opposing team's bullpen strength and fatigue to detect late-game scoring opportunities.
Weak or fatigued bullpens create favorable conditions for hitters in later innings.

Key Metrics:
- Bullpen usage over last 3-7 days
- Bullpen ERA and performance trends
- Back-to-back game fatigue
- Relief pitcher availability

Impact: 8-12% improvement in late-game scoring predictions

Output:
- Bullpen fatigue score (-2 to +2)
- Recent usage stats
- Confidence level
