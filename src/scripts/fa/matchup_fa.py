Pitcher-Hitter Matchup Factor Analysis

Analyzes historical performance of hitters vs specific pitchers and teams.
Provides matchup success rates based on past at-bats.

Key Metrics:
- Batting average in matchup
- Home runs in matchup
- Number of games/at-bats (confidence)
- Matchup advantage score

Output:
- Matchup score (-2 to +2)
- Historical stats (BA, HR, AB)
- Confidence level
