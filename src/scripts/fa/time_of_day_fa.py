Time of Day Analysis Factor

Analyzes the impact of game time (day vs night) on player fantasy production.
Different players perform better in day games vs night games based on various factors.

Key Concepts:
- Day Games (typically 1:00-4:00 PM): Different lighting, shadows, visibility
- Twilight Games (5:00-7:00 PM): Challenging lighting conditions, sun in eyes
- Night Games (after 7:00 PM): Consistent lighting, cooler temperatures
- Travel/Fatigue: Day games after night games affect performance

Performance Factors:
- Vision/Tracking: Ball visibility changes with lighting and shadows
- Temperature: Day games warmer, night games cooler (affects ball carry)
- Circadian Rhythms: Players' natural energy peaks at different times
- Historical Splits: Players often have consistent day/night performance patterns

Output:
- Game time classification (Day/Twilight/Night)
- Player's historical day/night splits
- Expected performance adjustment based on time of day
- Time-of-day advantage score
