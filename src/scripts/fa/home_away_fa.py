Home/Away Venue Factor Analysis

Analyzes player performance differences between home and away games.
Some players perform significantly better at home due to:
- Familiarity with stadium
- Travel/routine disruption
- Fan support
- Stadium-specific factors

Key Metrics:
- Home batting average vs Away batting average
- Home/away game counts
- Venue advantage score

Output:
- Venue score (-2 to +2)
- Home vs away splits
