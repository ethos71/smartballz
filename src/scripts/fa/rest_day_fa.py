Rest Day Impact Factor Analysis

Analyzes how days of rest affect player performance.
Players may perform differently when:
- Well-rested (2+ days off)
- Playing back-to-back games
- Long stretches without rest

Key Metrics:
- Rested performance (2+ days off)
- Back-to-back performance (0-1 days)
- Days since last game
- Rest advantage score

Output:
- Rest score (-2 to +2)
- Rested vs back-to-back splits
