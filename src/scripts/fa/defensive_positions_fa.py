Defensive Positions Factor Analysis

Analyzes expected defensive positions and shifts for fantasy baseball context.
Important: In fantasy baseball, rosters are locked 30 minutes before game time,
so mid-game defensive shifts cannot be exploited. This analyzes starting positions
and team defensive strategies that are set before the game.

Key Metrics:
- Starting defensive position assignment
- Team defensive shift tendencies
- Expected fielding opportunities by position
- Quality of defensive players at each position
- Impact on opposing hitters' production

Defensive Considerations:
- Strong defensive teams reduce opponent stats
- Weak defensive teams allow more hits/runs
- Specific position weaknesses (e.g., weak SS/2B)
- Shift tendencies against LHB/RHB

Output:
- Defensive impact score (-2.0 to +2.0)
- Expected starting position
- Opponent defensive rating
- Position-specific matchup quality
