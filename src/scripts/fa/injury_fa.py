Injury/Recovery Tracking Factor Analysis

Tracks player performance after injury recovery.
Players returning from injury may show:
- Reduced performance initially
- Gradual improvement over time
- Full recovery after adjustment period

Key Metrics:
- Pre-injury performance
- Post-injury performance
- Days since return
- Games since return
- Recovery status

Output:
- Injury score (-2 to +2)
- Recovery status (recovering, healthy, etc.)
