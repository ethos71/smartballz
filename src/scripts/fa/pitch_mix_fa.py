Pitch Mix Analysis Factor

Analyzes pitcher's pitch mix (types, frequencies, velocities) and batter's historical
performance against different pitch types to predict favorable/unfavorable matchups.

Key Concepts:
- Pitch Types: Fastball (4-seam, 2-seam, Cutter), Breaking (Slider, Curve), Offspeed (Change, Split)
- Usage Rates: Frequency each pitch type is thrown
- Pitcher Tendencies: Primary vs secondary pitches, situational usage
- Batter Performance: Success rates against different pitch types
- Matchup Analysis: Pitcher strengths vs batter weaknesses

Output:
- Pitch mix breakdown for pitchers
- Batter performance vs pitch types
- Matchup advantage score based on pitch mix vs batter tendencies
- Specific pitch type advantages/disadvantages
