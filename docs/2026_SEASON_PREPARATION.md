## Draft Strategy for 2026

### **Key Principles:**

1. **Prioritize Speed Early**
   - Steals are scarce - target 20+ SB players in rounds 1-8
   - Players: Acuña (65 SB), Witt (35 SB), Elly De La Cruz (60 SB)

2. **Avoid Injury Risks Early**
   - Wait on Fernando Tatis Jr., Byron Buxton, Royce Lewis
   - Don't reach for players with recent surgery history

3. **Don't Chase Closers**
   - Roles change constantly during season
   - Target elite setup men late (round 15+)
   - Stream closers during season

4. **Target Good Offenses**
   - LAD, ATL, BAL, HOU have elite lineups
   - More RBIs, Runs, better counting stats

5. **Age Sweet Spot: 24-28**
   - Peak performance years
   - Avoid 34+ unless proven elite (Freeman, Betts)

### **Round-by-Round Strategy:**

**Rounds 1-3:** Elite 5-tool players, safe anchors  
**Rounds 4-6:** Fill positions, target value picks  
**Rounds 7-10:** Power bats, ace SPs, breakout candidates  
**Rounds 11-15:** Upside plays, rookies, positional depth  
**Rounds 16+:** Pure upside, sleepers, streaming fodder

### **Auction Draft Strategy:**

**Budget Allocation (Total: $260):**
- Elite Tier ($45-55): 1-2 players
- Star Tier ($30-44): 2-3 players
- Mid-Tier ($15-29): 4-6 players
- Value Tier ($5-14): 6-10 players
- Dollar Bin ($1-4): Fill roster

**Key Targets:**
- Ronald Acuña: $55 (worth it)
- Bobby Witt Jr.: $42 (value play)
- Gunnar Henderson: $35 (breakout)
- Jackson Chourio: $8-12 (upside)

## Data Collection & Updates

### **What We Need to Build:**

   ```python
   # Add to src/scripts/scrape/
   - mlb_stats_api.py (player stats, projections)
   - prospect_rankings.py (MLB Pipeline integration)
   - steamer_projections.py (Projection system scraper)
   ```

2. **Spring Training Monitor**
   ```python
   # Add to src/scripts/
   - spring_training_tracker.py
   # Track: Injuries, roster battles, performance
   ```

3. **ADP Tracker**
   ```python
   # Add to src/scripts/scrape/
   - adp_tracker.py
   # Scrape: NFBC, Yahoo, ESPN ADPs
   ```

4. **Prospect Ranking Integration**
   ```python
   # Add to src/scripts/
   - prospect_rankings_updater.py
   # Sources: MLB Pipeline, Baseball America, FanGraphs
   ```
