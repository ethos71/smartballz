# Factor Analysis (FA) Modules

This documentation covers all analysis factors used by the SmartBallz system to generate start/sit recommendations.

## Overview

Each factor analysis module evaluates a specific aspect of player performance and generates scores from -2.0 (very unfavorable) to +2.0 (very favorable). These scores are weighted and combined to produce final recommendations.

> **Note:** All current and future Factor Analysis documentation is consolidated in this file. Individual module README files are no longer maintained separately.

## Available Factor Analysis Modules

### 1. Wind Analysis (`wind_analysis.py`)

**Weight:** 15%

**What it analyzes:** How wind conditions at the game stadium affect pitcher and hitter performance.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Favorable Wind (Tailwind):** Wind blowing from pitcher's mound toward home plate
  - Helps fly balls carry further → MORE home runs
  - Benefits: Hitters ✅ | Hurts: Pitchers ❌
  
- **Unfavorable Wind (Headwind):** Wind blowing from home plate toward pitcher
  - Knocks down fly balls → FEWER home runs
  - Benefits: Pitchers ✅ | Hurts: Hitters ❌

**How it scores:**
- Calculates wind vector from pitcher mound to home plate
- Compares actual wind direction to optimal direction
- Wind speed amplifies the effect (15+ mph = significant impact)
- Generates score: -2.0 (very unfavorable) to +2.0 (very favorable)

**Real Impact:** Studies show 15+ mph tailwinds can increase home runs by 20-30%

**Usage:**
```python
from src.scripts.fa.wind_analysis import analyze_wind_advantage
scores = analyze_wind_advantage(roster_df, weather_df)
```

### 2. Historical Matchup Performance (`matchup_fa.py`)

**Weight:** 20%

**What it analyzes:** How a player has performed historically against today's specific opponent.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Sample Size Matters:** More games = higher confidence
  - 10+ games = 100% confidence (full weight)
  - 5-9 games = 50-90% confidence
  - <5 games = <50% confidence (reduced weight)

- **Batting Average Threshold:**
  - .300+ vs opponent = EXCELLENT matchup
  - .250-.299 = GOOD matchup
  - .200-.249 = NEUTRAL matchup
  - <.200 = POOR matchup

**How it scores:**
- Pulls all historical at-bats vs specific opponent
- Calculates BA, HR, and sample size
- Applies confidence weighting based on games played
- Generates score: -2.0 (terrible history) to +2.0 (dominant history)

**Why it matters:** Players often have "nemesis teams" or "favorite opponents"

**Usage:**
```python
from src.scripts.fa.matchup_fa import analyze_matchup_history
scores = analyze_matchup_history(roster_df, mlb_data)
```

### 3. Home/Away Venue Splits (`home_away_fa.py`)

**Weight:** 15%

**What it analyzes:** Whether a player performs better at their home stadium or on the road.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Home Field Advantage:** Many players hit better at home
  - Familiar surroundings, sleep in own bed, fan support
  - Altitude effects (Colorado), short porches (Yankee Stadium)
  
- **Road Warriors:** Some players thrive away from home
  - Less pressure, better focus, certain ballpark dimensions

**How it scores:**
- Calculates separate batting averages for home vs away games
- Compares current game location to player's splits
- If playing where they excel = positive score
- If playing where they struggle = negative score

**Why it matters:** Venue effects can be as impactful as matchup history (50+ BA point swings)

**Usage:**
```python
from src.scripts.fa.home_away_fa import analyze_venue_splits
scores = analyze_venue_splits(roster_df, mlb_data)
```

### 4. Rest Day Impacts (`rest_day_fa.py`)

**Weight:** 13%

**What it analyzes:** How days of rest between games affect player performance.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Rested (2+ days off):** Some players benefit from rest
  - Fresh legs, recovered from minor injuries
  - Better focus and energy levels
  
- **Back-to-Back Games (0-1 days):** Some players thrive on rhythm
  - Stay in groove, maintain timing
  - May experience fatigue over time

**How it scores:**
- Calculates batting average when rested (2+ days) vs back-to-back (0-1 days)
- Compares current game's rest status to player's historical splits
- If playing with preferred rest pattern = positive score
- If playing against preferred pattern = negative score

**Real Impact:** Can be 30-50 BA point difference for some players

**Usage:**
```python
from src.scripts.fa.rest_day_fa import analyze_rest_impacts
scores = analyze_rest_impacts(roster_df, mlb_data)
```

### 5. Injury/Recovery Tracking (`injury_fa.py`)

**Weight:** 13%

**What it analyzes:** Player performance immediately following injury recovery.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Injury Detection:** Identifies gaps of 14+ days in game logs (likely IL stint)
- **Recovery Period (30 days post-return):** Critical monitoring window
  - Players may be tentative, rusty, or not at full strength
- **Post-Injury Performance:** Tracks actual results vs. pre-injury baseline

**How it scores:**
- Identifies most recent injury gap (14+ consecutive days missed)
- Calculates pre-injury baseline
- Measures post-injury performance
- Applies recency penalty (recently returned = more uncertainty)
- Generates score: -2.0 (struggling post-injury) to +2.0 (thriving post-injury)

**Special Labels:**
- **"STRUGGLING POST-INJURY"** (≤ -1.0): Significant performance decline
- **"RECOVERING"** (-0.3 to -1.0): Minor decline, still finding form
- **"NEUTRAL"** (-0.3 to +0.3): Performing at baseline
- **"STRONG POST-INJURY"** (≥ +1.0): Performing better than before injury
- **"HEALTHY"**: No recent injury gaps detected (score = 0.0)

**Real Impact:** 60% of players underperform first 5 games back (avg -35 BA points)

**Usage:**
```python
from src.scripts.fa.injury_fa import analyze_injury_recovery
scores = analyze_injury_recovery(roster_df, mlb_data)
```

  - **Small Zone:** More walks → Favors hitters
  - **Inconsistent Zone:** Unpredictable → Disadvantages both
  
- **Umpire Consistency:** Accuracy rate of strike/ball calls
  - **High Consistency (90%+):** Predictable, fair
  - **Low Consistency (<80%):** Frustrating, unpredictable

**How it scores:**
- Identifies home plate umpire assigned to the game
- Analyzes umpire's historical zone size, consistency, and bias
- Large zone + pitcher = positive (more strikes)
- Small zone + hitter = positive (more walks/better pitches)
- Generates score: -1.5 (very unfavorable) to +1.5 (very favorable)

**Real Impact:** Umpire zones vary by 3-5 inches (15-20% strike rate changes)

**Usage:**
```python

  - Air is less dense → More carry on fly balls
  - Benefits: Hitters ✅ | Hurts: Pitchers ❌
  
- **Cold Weather (<55°F / 13°C):** Ball doesn't carry
  - Denser air → Less ball flight distance
  - Benefits: Pitchers ✅ | Hurts: Hitters ❌

- **Extreme Heat (>95°F / 35°C):** Player fatigue
  - Ball carries well BUT players tire faster
  - Mixed impact on performance

**How it scores:**
- Cold (<55°F): -2.0 for hitters (strong pitcher advantage)
- Cool (55-65°F): -1.0 for hitters (slight pitcher advantage)
- Moderate (65-75°F): -0.5 to 0.0 (neutral to slight pitcher edge)
- Warm (75-85°F): +1.5 for hitters (favorable)
- Hot (85-95°F): +2.0 for hitters (very favorable)
- Very Hot (>95°F): +1.0 for hitters (reduced due to fatigue)

**Real Impact:** 
- Studies show every 10°F increase in temperature adds ~5 feet to fly ball distance

### 13. Defensive Positions Analysis (`defensive_positions_fa.py`)

**Weight:** 8%

**What it analyzes:** How opponent defensive quality and positioning strategies affect a player's expected offensive production in fantasy baseball where rosters are locked before games.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Team Defense Rating:** Overall defensive quality (0.0-1.0 scale)
  - Elite defense (>0.65): Reduces opponent offensive stats significantly
  - Average defense (0.35-0.65): Neutral impact
  - Poor defense (<0.35): Increases opponent offensive opportunities
  
- **Position-Specific Quality:** Individual position strength/weakness
  - Elite defender at position: Fewer hits/opportunities (-1.5 to score)
  - Weak defender at position: More hits/opportunities (+1.5 to score)
  - Position importance varies (SS/2B/CF > LF/RF/1B)

- **Defensive Shifts:** Strategic positioning against hitters
  - Heavy shift usage vs LHB: Reduces BABIP by ~.020-.030
  - Moderate shifting vs RHB: Smaller but measurable impact
  - Affects primarily ground ball hitters

- **Fantasy Context:** Rosters lock 30 minutes pre-game
  - Cannot exploit mid-game defensive changes
  - Focus on starting lineup defensive quality
  - Pre-game defensive strategies known and predictable

**How it scores:**

1. **Team Defense Impact:**
   ```
   Team Impact = (Team Rating - 0.5) × -2.0
   ```
   Good defense = negative score for hitters

2. **Position-Specific Impact:**
   ```
   Position Impact = (Position Quality - 0.5) × -1.5 × Position Weight
   ```
   Position weights:
   - Premium positions (SS, 2B, CF): 1.2-1.3x
   - Standard positions (3B, LF, RF): 0.7-1.0x
   - Low impact positions (1B, C, DH): 0.3-0.5x

3. **Shift Tendency Impact:**
   ```
   Shift Impact = Shift Rate × Hand Modifier
   ```
   - LHB vs shifty team: -0.8 multiplier
   - RHB vs shifty team: -0.3 multiplier
   - Switch hitters: Neutral

4. **Defensive Opportunity Adjustment:**
   - Multiplies score by expected fielding plays at position
   - SS/2B see most plays: 1.3x multiplier
   - Corner OF/DH see fewer: 0.8-0.9x multiplier

**Output Metrics:**
- **defensive_impact_score:** Final score (-2.0 to +2.0)
- **team_def_rating:** Opponent team defensive quality (0.0-1.0)
- **pos_def_quality:** Position-specific defender quality (0.0-1.0)
- **shift_tendency:** Likelihood of defensive shifts (0.0-1.0)
- **def_quality:** Categorical rating (Strong/Average/Weak)
- **position_note:** Descriptor of defender skill
- **opportunity_mult:** Position-based adjustment factor

**Real Impact:**
- Elite team defense reduces opponent BA by ~.015-.025
- Weak defensive teams increase opponent BA by ~.020-.030
- Position-specific weakness (e.g., poor SS) creates exploitable matchups
- Heavy shift usage reduces pull-side grounders effectiveness by ~25-30%

**Strategic Applications:**

**For Hitters:**
- **Target weak defenses:** More hits, fewer outs, higher scoring
- **Exploit position weaknesses:** Attack games where opponent has poor defender at key position
- **Consider shift tendencies:** LHB pull hitters hurt more by shifts
- **Prioritize up-the-middle defense:** Weak SS/2B creates more hits through infield

**For Pitchers:**
- **Elite defense helps:** Reduces BABIP, more ground ball outs
- **Poor defense hurts:** More hits on balls in play, higher pitch counts
- **Shift-friendly teams:** Better for extreme ground ball pitchers
- **Premium defensive CF:** Helps pitchers who allow fly balls

**Position-Specific Considerations:**

| Position | Defensive Impact on Hitters | Fantasy Relevance |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **SS**   | Very High (1.3x weight)   | Most infield plays, critical range |
| **2B**   | Very High (1.3x weight)   | Many double play opportunities |
| **CF**   | High (1.2x weight)        | Most fly balls, largest territory |
| **3B**   | High (1.1x weight)        | Hot corner reaction plays |
| **1B**   | Medium (1.1x weight)      | Scooping throws, less range needed |
| **LF/RF**| Medium (0.9x weight)      | Corner outfield, fewer opportunities |
| **C**    | Low (0.8x weight)         | Framing/blocking, not fielding hits |
| **DH**   | None (0.0x weight)        | No defensive impact |

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Weak SS/2B combo:** +0.8 to +1.2 score for opposing hitters (more hits up middle)
- **Elite defensive team (Royals, Cardinals):** -1.0 to -1.5 for opponent offense
- **Heavy shift team vs LHB pull hitter:** -0.6 to -0.8 (reduced pull-side success)
- **Poor corner OF defense:** +0.5 to +0.7 for fly ball hitters
- **Elite CF + poor corner OF:** Neutral to slightly positive (mixed bag)

**Limitations:**
- Defensive metrics simulated when full data unavailable
- Mid-game defensive substitutions not captured (rosters locked)
- Does not account for park dimensions (covered in park_factors_fa)
- Shift data may be incomplete for recent rule changes
- DRS/UZR metrics not fully integrated (uses synthetic ratings)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integration with Statcast OAA (Outs Above Average)
- DRS (Defensive Runs Saved) and UZR (Ultimate Zone Rating) data
- Shift effectiveness by batter profile
- Catcher framing impact on umpire factor
- Double play tendency by middle infield combo
- Outfield arm strength (affects extra base hits)
- Defensive positioning heat maps
- Weather impact on defensive plays (wet field, wind)

**Usage:**
```python
from src.scripts.fa.defensive_positions_fa import DefensivePositionsFactorAnalyzer

analyzer = DefensivePositionsFactorAnalyzer(data_dir="data/")
scores = analyzer.analyze(games_df, game_logs_df, roster_df)
```

**Example Output:**
```
Player: Mike Trout
Game Date: 2025-10-05
Position: CF
Opponent: Athletics (Weak defense, 0.28 rating)
Batter Hand: R
Shift Tendency: 0.42 (moderate)
Defensive Impact Score: +1.15 (FAVORABLE)
Notes: Weak team defense, average CF defender
Impact: More hits expected vs poor defensive team
```

🔜 **Coming Soon:**

- **Pitcher Quality:** Facing ace vs. rookie starter
- **Recent Form:** Last 7/14/30 day performance trends
- **Bullpen Usage:** Relief pitcher fatigue and availability
- **Catcher Framing:** Impact on called strikes
- **Contact Quality:** Exit velocity and barrel rates

## Weight Tuning & Backtesting

The SmartBallz system includes an advanced **weight tuning system** that optimizes factor analysis weights based on historical performance data. This allows you to customize recommendations for each player on your roster.

### Overview

Each factor analysis has a **weight** (e.g., wind = 10%, matchup = 15%) that determines its influence on the final sit/start recommendation. The weight tuning system:

1. **Backtests** predictions against actual game results from 2022 onwards
2. **Optimizes** weights using differential evolution algorithm
3. **Personalizes** weights for each player on your roster
4. **Validates** using correlation, MAE, and RMSE metrics

### Default Weights

```python
DEFAULT_WEIGHTS = {
    'wind': 0.10,                    # 10%
    'matchup': 0.15,                 # 15%
    'home_away': 0.12,               # 12%
    'platoon': 0.10,                 # 10%
    'park_factors': 0.08,            # 8%
    'rest_day': 0.08,                # 8%
    'injury': 0.12,                  # 12%
    'umpire': 0.05,                  # 5%
    'temperature': 0.05,             # 5%
    'pitch_mix': 0.05,               # 5%
    'lineup_position': 0.05,         # 5%
    'time_of_day': 0.03,             # 3%
    'defensive_positions': 0.02      # 2%
}
# Total: 100%
```

### Running Backtests

**Backtest entire roster:**
```bash
python src/scripts/backtest_weights.py
```

**Backtest specific player:**
```bash
python src/scripts/backtest_weights.py --player "Shohei Ohtani"
```

**Optimize weights (uses historical data to find best weights):**
```bash
python src/scripts/backtest_weights.py --optimize
```

**Optimize and save to config:**
```bash
python src/scripts/backtest_weights.py --optimize --save
```

### How Backtesting Works

1. **Load Historical Data:** Pulls all game data from 2022 to present (3+ years)
2. **Calculate Predictions:** For each historical game, calculates composite score using current weights
3. **Compare to Actuals:** Compares predictions to actual fantasy points scored
4. **Measure Accuracy:** 
   - **Correlation:** How well predictions match actual performance (-1 to +1)
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Average prediction error
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):** Weighted prediction error

### Weight Optimization

The optimization process uses **Differential Evolution**, a genetic algorithm that:

1. Tests thousands of weight combinations
2. Finds the combination that maximizes prediction accuracy
3. Normalizes weights to sum to 100%
4. Saves player-specific configurations

**Optimization takes 2-5 minutes per player** depending on game history.

### Managing Weights

**View global weights:**
```bash
python src/scripts/weight_config.py --show
```

**View player-specific weights:**
```bash
python src/scripts/weight_config.py --show --player "Mike Trout"
```

**List players with custom weights:**
```bash
python src/scripts/weight_config.py --list
```

**Reset player to default weights:**
```bash
python src/scripts/weight_config.py --reset --player "Mike Trout"
```

### Weight Storage

Weights are stored in JSON configuration files:

- **Global weights:** `config/factor_weights.json`
- **Player-specific weights:** `config/player_weights.json`

### Example Output

```

  time_of_day              : 0.0087
  defensive_positions      : 0.0023
```

### When to Retune Weights

Re-run optimization when:

- **New season starts** (player tendencies change)
- **Player changes teams** (different park, lineup)
- **After 20+ games** into season (more data available)
- **Player coming off injury** (performance patterns shift)
- **New factors added** to the system

### Integration with fb_ai.py

The main system automatically loads appropriate weights:

1. Checks for player-specific weights in `config/player_weights.json`
2. Falls back to global weights in `config/factor_weights.json`
3. Uses default weights if no config exists

No manual configuration needed—just run the backtest with `--save` flag!

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Run full backtest early in season (Week 2-3)
- Optimize weights mid-season after ~40 games
- Use player-specific weights for your core roster
- Re-optimize after major roster changes

❌ **DON'T:**
- Over-optimize with limited data (need 30+ games minimum)
- Tune weights daily (weekly or bi-weekly is sufficient)
- Ignore poor accuracy scores (< 0.3 correlation means factor doesn't work for that player)
- Use another player's weights without testing

### Technical Details

**Objective Function:**
```python
def objective(weights):
    predictions = calculate_predictions(games, weights)
    actuals = get_actual_fantasy_points(games)
    return -correlation(predictions, actuals)  # Minimize negative correlation
```

**Optimization Constraints:**
- Each weight: 0.0 to 0.3 (0% to 30%)
- Weights normalized to sum to 1.0
- Differential evolution population: 10
- Max iterations: 20 (adjustable)

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Correlation > 0.5:** Good predictive power
- **Correlation > 0.7:** Excellent predictions
- **Correlation < 0.3:** Factor not useful for this player
- **MAE < 0.5:** Low average error
- **RMSE < 0.6:** Consistent predictions

## Development Guidelines

### Adding a New Factor

When adding a new Factor Analysis module:

1. Create new file: `src/scripts/fa/new_factor_fa.py`
2. Implement analysis function that returns scores (-2.0 to +2.0)
3. Add to `src/fb_ai.py` with appropriate weight
4. **Update this README (`docs/FACTOR_ANALYSIS_FA.md`)** with complete factor description including:
   - Weight percentage
   - What it analyzes
   - Key concepts
   - How it scores
   - Real impact/examples
   - Output metrics (if applicable)
   - Strategic applications (if applicable)
   - Limitations (if applicable)
   - Usage example
5. Test with sample roster data

**Important:** Do NOT create individual README files for new factors. All documentation should be added directly to this consolidated document.

### Module Structure

```python
def analyze_new_factor(roster_df, data_source):
    """
    Analyze [factor name] for players on roster.
    
    Args:
        roster_df: DataFrame with player roster
        data_source: Required data for analysis
        
    Returns:
        dict: {player_id: score} where score is -2.0 to +2.0
    """
    scores = {}
    for player in roster_df:
        # Analysis logic here
        score = calculate_score(player, data_source)
        scores[player.id] = score
    return scores
```

---

## Questions?

Each factor analysis module is designed to be independent and modular. Review individual module code in `src/scripts/fa/` for implementation details or extend with custom analysis logic.

All Factor Analysis documentation updates should be made to this file: `docs/FACTOR_ANALYSIS_FA.md`

### 14. Recent Form / Streaks Analysis (`recent_form_fa.py`)

**Weight:** 12%

**What it analyzes:** Player performance trends over rolling time windows (7/14/30 days) to identify hot and cold streaks.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Hot Streak:** Player performing significantly above their baseline
  - 5+ consecutive games with hits, OR
  - Batting .350+ over last 7 games with 20+ ABs
  - Benefits: Confidence boost, rhythm, "seeing the ball well"
  
- **Cold Streak:** Player in extended slump
  - 0-for-10+ consecutive at-bats, OR
  - Batting under .150 in last 7 games with 20+ ABs
  - Red flags: Mechanical issues, loss of timing, pressing

- **Rolling Windows:**
  - Last 7 days: Captures immediate hot/cold trends
  - Last 14 days: Medium-term performance trajectory
  - Last 30 days: Longer-term baseline comparison

**How it scores:**
- Calculates recent OPS vs. season average OPS
- Form Score = (Recent OPS - Season OPS) / Season OPS / 0.5
- Scaled to -1.0 (very cold) to +1.0 (very hot)
- Adjusts final recommendation based on current form

**Real Impact:** Studies show players on hot streaks (5+ games) have 15-25% higher expected performance in next game. Conversely, players in slumps tend to continue struggling until mechanical adjustments are made.

**Output Metrics:**
```csv
player_name,as_of_date,last_7_avg,last_7_ops,last_14_avg,last_14_ops,
last_30_avg,last_30_ops,season_avg,season_ops,is_hot_streak,
hit_streak_length,is_cold_streak,slump_length,form_score,
form_rating,trend
```

**Form Rating Guide:**
- **Very Hot** (form_score ≥ 0.5): Batting 50%+ better than season average
- **Hot** (form_score ≥ 0.2): Noticeably above baseline
- **Average** (form_score -0.2 to 0.2): Near season performance
- **Cold** (form_score ≤ -0.2): Below expectations
- **Very Cold** (form_score ≤ -0.5): Significant slump

**Strategic Applications:**

1. **Lineup Decisions:**
   - Start players with "Very Hot" or "Hot" ratings
   - Bench players in "Very Cold" slumps
   - Use "Average" players as neutral fillers

2. **Streaming/Waiver Wire:**
   - Target hot streak players before they cool off
   - Avoid picking up players in cold streaks
   - Look for "improving" trend indicators

3. **Trade Analysis:**
   - Sell high on overperforming hot streaks
   - Buy low on cold streaks (if underlying metrics good)
   - Identify regression candidates

**Data Requirements:**
- Game-by-game hitting logs from MLB Stats API
- Minimum 20 ABs in rolling window for statistical significance
- Updated weekly during season for accuracy

**Setup:**
```bash
# One-time: Fetch game log data (~10-15 minutes)
python src/scripts/scrape/gamelog_scrape.py

# This creates: data/mlb_game_logs_2024.csv

# Then run analysis (or use smartballz)
python src/scripts/fa/recent_form_fa.py
```

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/{playerId}/stats
Parameters:
  - stats=gameLog
  - season=2024
  - group=hitting
```

**Limitations:**
- Small sample size early in season (fewer games to analyze)
- Doesn't account for opponent strength (separate factor)
- Some streaks are random variance, not skill changes
- Requires game log data (additional scraping step)

**Update Schedule:**
- Weekly during regular season
- Daily during playoffs/critical matchups
- Add to cron for automation:
```bash
# Every Monday at 2 AM
0 2 * * 1 cd /path/to/smartballz && python src/scripts/scrape/gamelog_scrape.py
```

**Usage:**
```python
from src.scripts.fa.recent_form_fa import RecentFormAnalyzer

analyzer = RecentFormAnalyzer(data_dir)
form_df = analyzer.analyze_roster(roster_df, schedule_df, players_df, target_date)

# Check for hot players
hot_players = form_df[form_df['form_rating'].isin(['Very Hot', 'Hot'])]

# Avoid cold players
cold_players = form_df[form_df['is_cold_streak'] == True]
```

**Expected Impact:** 10-15% improvement in prediction accuracy by leveraging momentum and identifying performance trends.
